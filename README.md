# RF-Frequency-Recognition

**Automatic RF-Frequency-Recognition**

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Automatic RF Frequency Recognition** project. This project aims to develop an application capable of automatically recognizing and classifying different radiofrequencies (RF) in real time, using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. This document details the action plan for structuring, developing and deploying this project.

## Project objectives

### Main Objectives
- **RF Signal Classification**: Automatically identify and classify different types of RF signals (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LTE, etc.).
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual or unauthorized signals.
- **Spectrum Optimization**: Assist in dynamic frequency management to reduce interference.

### Use cases
- **Security & Surveillance**: Detect unauthorized transmissions.
- **Spectrum Management**: Dynamic frequency allocation in communication networks.
- **Aeronautical and Satellite Applications**: Monitoring of air and space communications.
